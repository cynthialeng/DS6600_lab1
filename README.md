## License
I chose GNU General Public License v3.0 because it allows commercial use, distribution and modification, but requires that derivatives be released under the same license. 

If I had not supplied a license, it would be "all rights reserved" which is the defalt option. This means that other people would not be allowed to use, modify, or distribute this code at all.
